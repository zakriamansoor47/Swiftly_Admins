## Building

- Open the project in your preferred .NET IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Rider, VS Code).
- Build the project. The output DLL and resources will be placed in the `build/` directory.
- The publish process will also create a zip file for easy distribution.

## Publishing

- Use the `dotnet publish -c Release` command to build and package your plugin.
- Distribute the generated zip file or the contents of the `build/publish` directory.

## Database Connection Key

The database connection is using the key `admins`. It supports SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL.

## Immunity Mode

The Immunity Mode system controls how admins can interact with other admins based on their immunity levels. You can configure this in your `config.json` file under the `ImmunityMode` property.

### Available Modes

#### Mode 0: Ignore Immunity (IgnoreImmunity)
- **Behavior**: Any admin can affect any other admin, regardless of immunity levels.
- **Use Case**: Completely disable the immunity system.
- **Config Value**: `0`

#### Mode 1: Protect from Lower Access (ProtectFromLowerAccess)
- **Behavior**: Admins can only affect other admins with lower or equal immunity levels.
- **Example**: An admin with immunity 50 can affect admins with immunity 0-49, but not 50+.
- **Config Value**: `1`

#### Mode 2: Protect from Equal or Lower Access (ProtectFromEqualOrLowerAccess)
- **Behavior**: Same as Mode 1 - admins can only affect other admins with strictly lower immunity levels.
- **Note**: Currently identical to Mode 1 in behavior.
- **Config Value**: `2`

#### Mode 3: Protect with No Immunity Bypass (ProtectWithNoImmunityBypass)
- **Default**: No
- **Behavior**: Same protection as Mode 2, except admins with 0 immunity can affect each other regardless.
- **Use Case**: Allow newer admins (immunity 0) to affect each other, while protecting admins with immunity.
- **Config Value**: `3`

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "ImmunityMode": 1
}
```

## Server Console Admin Management

You can manage admins and groups directly from the server console using the `sw_admins` and `sw_groups` commands. These commands are essential for initial setup and when you don't have access to in-game commands.

### Admin Management via Console (`sw_admins`)

The `sw_admins` command allows you to manage administrators from the server console.

#### Give Admin Privileges

**Syntax:**
```
sw_admins give <steamid64> <username> <immunity> [permissions] [groups] [server_guids]
```

**Parameters:**
- `<steamid64>` - Player's SteamID64 (required)
- `<username>` - Display name for the admin (required)
- `<immunity>` - Immunity level (0-100, higher = more immunity) (required)
- `[permissions]` - Comma-separated list of permissions (optional)
- `[groups]` - Comma-separated list of group names (optional)
- `[server_guids]` - Comma-separated list of additional server GUIDs (optional)

**Examples:**
```
# Basic admin with immunity 50
sw_admins give 76561198123456789 "PlayerName" 50

# Admin with specific permissions
sw_admins give 76561198123456789 "PlayerName" 75 "admins.commands.ban,admins.commands.kick"

# Admin with group membership
sw_admins give 76561198123456789 "PlayerName" 80 "" "moderators,vip"

# Admin with full permissions and multiple servers
sw_admins give 76561198123456789 "PlayerName" 100 "admins.commands.*" "admin" "guid-server-1,guid-server-2"
```

#### Edit Admin Properties

**Syntax:**
```
sw_admins edit <steamid64> <field> <value>
```

**Fields:**
- `username` - Change admin's display name
- `immunity` - Change immunity level
- `permissions` - Update permissions (comma-separated)
- `groups` - Update group memberships (comma-separated)
- `servers` - Update server GUIDs (comma-separated)

**Examples:**
```
# Change username
sw_admins edit 76561198123456789 username "NewName"

# Update immunity
sw_admins edit 76561198123456789 immunity 90

# Change permissions
sw_admins edit 76561198123456789 permissions "admins.commands.ban,admins.commands.mute"

# Update groups
sw_admins edit 76561198123456789 groups "admin,moderator"

# Update server access
sw_admins edit 76561198123456789 servers "guid-1,guid-2,guid-3"
```

#### Remove Admin

**Syntax:**
```
sw_admins remove <steamid64>
```

**Example:**
```
sw_admins remove 76561198123456789
```

**Note:** This removes the admin from the current server. If the admin has access to other servers, they will only be removed from the database when removed from all servers.

#### List All Admins

**Syntax:**
```
sw_admins list
```

This displays all admins configured for the current server, showing:
- Username
- SteamID64
- Immunity level
- Groups
- Permissions

### Group Management via Console (`sw_groups`)

The `sw_groups` command allows you to manage permission groups from the server console.

#### Create/Give Group

**Syntax:**
```
sw_groups give <group_name> <immunity> [permissions] [server_guids]
```

# Multi-server group
sw_groups give global-admins 90 "admins.commands.*" "guid-1,guid-2,guid-3"
```

**Note:** If a group with the same name already exists, this command will update it and add the current server to its server list.

#### Edit Group

```
sw_groups edit <group_name> <immunity> [permissions] [server_guids]
```

**Parameters:**
- `<group_name>` - Name of the group to edit (required)

# Add servers to group
sw_groups edit moderators 60 "admins.commands.ban,admins.commands.kick" "new-server-guid"
```

#### Remove Group

**Syntax:**
```
sw_groups remove <group_name>
```

**Example:**
```

### Common Console Admin Setup Examples

#### Example 1: Initial Server Setup

sw_groups give moderator 50 "admins.commands.ban,admins.commands.kick,admins.commands.mute,admins.commands.gag"
sw_groups give vip 10 "admins.commands.noclip"

# Add yourself as owner
sw_groups give 76561198123456789 "YourName" 100 "" "owner"

# Add other admins
sw_admins give 76561198987654321 "AdminName" 90 "" "admin"
sw_admins give 76561198111111111 "ModeratorName" 50 "" "moderator"
```

```bash
# Give someone full access temporarily (you can adjust later)
sw_admins give 76561198123456789 "TempAdmin" 100 "admins.commands.*"
```

#### Example 3: Fix Admin Permissions

```bash
# If an admin can't use certain commands, update their permissions
sw_admins edit 76561198123456789 permissions "admins.commands.*"

# Or add them to a proper group
sw_admins edit 76561198123456789 groups "admin"
```

### Permission Wildcards

You can use wildcards in permissions:
